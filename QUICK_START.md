# Monster Hunter Frontier G - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Binary Analysis
```bash
python binary_analyzer.py
```
This will analyze the game files for network protocol information.

### 2. Network Traffic Capture
```bash
python network_analyzer.py
```
This will create a capture script for network traffic analysis.

### 3. Start Server
```bash
python server_framework.py
```
This starts a basic MHF server for testing.

## File Structure
- `Monster Hunter Frontier G/` - Game files
- `analysis_results/` - Analysis output
- `captured_traffic/` - Network captures
- `server_data/` - Server data storage
- `logs/` - Log files

## Next Steps
1. Run binary analysis to understand the protocol
2. Capture network traffic during gameplay
3. Cross-reference binary and network analysis
4. Implement server features based on findings

## Tools Needed
- Wireshark (for network capture)
- Ghidra (for binary analysis)
- Python 3.8+ (already installed)

## Community Resources
- MHF Discord servers
- GBAtemp forums
- GitHub repositories for existing projects
