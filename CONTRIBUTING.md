# Contributing to Monster Hunter Frontier G Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Monster Hunter Frontier G server project! This project aims to reverse engineer and recreate the online functionality of Monster Hunter Frontier G.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of network protocols
- Familiarity with Monster Hunter games (helpful but not required)

### Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mhf-frontier-server.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the setup: `python setup.py`

## Areas for Contribution

### 1. Protocol Analysis
- **Binary Analysis**: Help analyze the game files for network protocol information
- **Network Traffic**: Capture and analyze network packets during gameplay
- **Documentation**: Document findings and create protocol specifications

### 2. Server Development
- **Authentication System**: Implement login and session management
- **Character System**: Handle character data and progression
- **Guild System**: Implement guild halls and member management
- **Quest System**: Handle quest data and multiplayer sessions
- **Chat System**: Implement in-game communication

### 3. Tools and Utilities

- **Testing Tools**: Develop tools for testing server functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation and guides

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Commit with descriptive messages: `git commit -m "Add authentication system"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
6. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `Add binary analysis tool for network protocol detection`
- `Fix authentication packet parsing`
- `Update documentation with new findings`
- `Implement basic guild hall functionality`
